# YouMe

YouMe is a library that makes it easier to work with the [WebMIDI API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_MIDI_API)
within the [Fluid Infusion ecosystem](https://fluidproject.org/infusion.html).

## Using YouMe in Your Code

YouMe is published to npm and can be installed in your project using a command like:

`npm install --save youme`

## Requirements

The components in this package require:

1. The dependencies of this package, which you can install using a command like `npm install`.
2. A compatible browser.  At time of writing, this includes:
   - Chromium and derivatives, like Chrome, Edge, and Opera.
   - Firefox 108 or higher.

## Try It!

This package provides a few demonstrations that you can try out in your browser. Once you have installed all
dependencies (see above), open [the demonstration page](demos/index.html) in a compatible browser.

## Tests

This package includes a test suite. Once you have installed dependencies, you can run the tests using the command
`npm test`. You must have a compatible browser (see above) to run the tests. By default, the tests run against
instrumented code in order to verify test code coverage. They also run in continuous integration mode, launching all
supported browsers in turn and exiting when the tests have finished running.

If you want to debug tests in your browser, you can launch Testem without instrumentation and in "development mode"
using a command like:

`DISABLE_INSTRUMENTATION=true node node_modules/.bin/testem --file tests/testem.js`

Follow the onscreen instructions and connect your browser to the URL provided by Testem.

If you want to run the tests without Testem, you will need to host the code in a test server to avoid browser
sandbox issues. As an example, if you have `python3` installed, you can:

- Host the content by running a command like `python3 http.server` from the root of the repository
- Open [`tests/all-tests.html`](http://localhost:8000/tests/all-tests.html) in a compatible browser.

## Migrating from `flocking-midi` (and earlier versions of Flocking )

This package is based on and extends the original [flocking-midi](https://github.com/continuing-creativity/flocking-midi)
project, and was written in conversation with that package's author. `flocking-midi` was itself originally part of
[Flocking](https://github.com/continuing-creativity/flocking). Users coming from either of those environments will see
some familiar grades, but there are a few key differences in this package that are worth noting.

First, this package is written to take advantage of features new to Infusion 4.x.  As such, it cannot be run with
earlier versions of Infusion.

Second, this package no longer depends on `Flocking` for its UI components. If you are building your front end using
Infusion, this package provides sample UI components, see [the UI component documentation](docs/ui-components.md) for
more information.

The new [`portConnector`](docs/core-components.md) grades provide a UI-agnostic means of connecting to and relaying
messages to/from MIDI ports. If you are using something other than Infusion to build your front-end interface, or are
working without a user interface, you should build your work on top of these grades.
